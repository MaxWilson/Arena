               let! feedback, context = ReturnAction(SimpleAttack)
               return if feedback > 0 then Success else Failure

               From the caller's perspective, this looks like two separate, nested behaviors

               let AwaitingAction(action1, continuation) = behavior(...) // this is the ReturnAction
               let Finished Failure = continuation (feedback, context) // Here's where we consume feedback and evaluate it to produce a result.

               So even though it LOOKS at first like it's weird for feedback and context to get fed to followupBehavior, it actually makes sense
               because mem and action are outputs whereas feedback and context are inputs.
